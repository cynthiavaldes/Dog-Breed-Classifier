# Dog-Breed-Classifier
## Description  
A machine learning project that takes in photos of differing dog breeds to learn to classify about 360 dog breeds. This was just a project to try out machine learning on a larger scale and to practice more Python related coding, the dataset included 20,579 images broken into 10,357 as the testing set and 10,222 as the training set. The model ended up being sort of accurate as it would succesffuly tell the dog breed around 50% of the time, the images fed into the model being resized into a fized size of 224, 224, 3 with the Tensor format to properly predit and classify the images. For the statistical results, there was very good performance for the training loss but the validation loss increased as the model predicted with the data set. While the accuracy of the training set was very good while the validation accuracy was average. the result images are below.
